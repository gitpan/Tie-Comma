Tie::Comma, version 0.04
========================

This module provides Yet Another way to format numbers with commas,
this time via a tied hash.  This makes it very easy to format a number
while inserting it into a string.

EXAMPLES

 # Simple formatting with commas:
 $a = 1234567.89;
 print "With commas: $comma{$a}";      => "With commas: 1,234,567.89"

 # Specify number of decimal places:
 print "1 decimal:   $comma{$a,1}";    => "1 decimal:   1,234,567.9"
 print "3 decimals:  $comma{$a,3}";    => "3 decimals:  1,234,567.890"

 # Specify field width:
 print "Min width:  '$comma{$a,0,12}'" => "Min width:  '   1,234,568'

 # In-string computations:
 print "Seconds in a year: $comma{365 * 24 * 60 * 60}";
    => "Seconds in a year: 31,536,000";

DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is an early version of this module, so who knows what bugs lurk.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Comma surprises you, I
would be grateful if you could send me an email message about it.
Thanks.
